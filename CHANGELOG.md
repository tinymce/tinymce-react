- Caught exceptions thrown while trying to restore selection after setting content

## 3.11.0 - 2021-03-23

### Changed
- Updates to `initialValue` after editor initialization will now be detected and applied and will result in a complete reset of undo state. #INT-2367
- During `componentDidUpdate` the `value` prop will be applied if it is different to the current editor content even when it is not different to the previous value of the `value` prop. #INT-2372

### Fixed
- Apply changes to `initialValue`, `value` and `disabled` which occur between editor setup and initialization that were previously ignored. #INT-2371
- An attempt will be made to retain the cursor position when the `value` prop forces an update to the editor content. If the cursor position can not be found it will return to the start of the document as before. #INT-2370
- Internal tracking of the current content is now always done in HTML so `outputFormat` should not cause any unexpected behavior. #INT-2369

### Deprecated
- The `outputFormat` prop will be removed in a future release. If text output is required call `editor.getContent({ format: 'text' })` in any of the event callbacks. #INT-2368
